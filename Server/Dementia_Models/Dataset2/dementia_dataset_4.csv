to get some cookies for him and his sister; he’s just handing a cookie
down to his sister while getting another one. The cookie jar is on the
top shelf; he’s standing on a stool and the stool is just about to fall
over. So we are about to have him falling on the floor, probably hitting

Beside it there’s more plates and cups ready to go into wash. Her
children, I assume they’re her children, are behind her and what they’re
doing is raiding the cookie jar by climbing up on top of a stool; the
girl is helping her brother by taking the cookies from him while he’s
tilting back on the stool and it looks as if he’s about to fall. The
lady who’s doing the drying up actually has her feet in the water and is
getting wet, not only because the sink is overflowing but also because
it’s now running across the floor. The cookie jar has its lid off but it
looks as if it’s so full that the lid couldn’t even fit on. Outside the
window, which is curtains, which are held back by some kind of rope,
there’s a garden where you have some kind of trestle and the window
itself is open; you can’t see a great detail in the garden though it
looks as if there may be grass and trees out there; maybe I’m implying
that. The rest of the kitchen looks like a traditional image or cartoon
of a kitchen.

to fall off. The girl has put her left hand up to try and take a biscuit
from him. The mother is by the kitchen sink, which is overflowing with
water from the tap which is switched on, and it, water’s pouring all
over the floor. The mother’s holding a plate in her left hand and
drying, trying to dry it with her right hand, and seems oblivious to
what’s going on with the water in the sink overflowing; she’s obviously
trying to do the washing up. There are curtains in the window and
outside you can see the path leading to her door; and the window looks
like it might be open, I’m not sure; no, it’s probably just a sheet of
glass; leading down to the garden gate, and she’s got flower beds and a
lawn, by the looks of things, and there’s a tree through the window as
well. There are cupboards in the kitchen; they’re all shut apart from
the one on the top shelf going up to the cookie draw. The mother is
wearing um a dress with something like a, an apron in the front; she’s
got bare sleeves, um it must be summer or spring. The boy’s wearing

cookies from the jar; the lid is off, there were five, the boy’s grabbed
one which he’s passing to the little girl, I assume is his sister, he’s
got the other one in his hand. He doesn’t seem the least bit bothered
that the er stool’s toppling over. His socks are coming down; he’s

is washing up but she’s distracted and she’s letting the water overflow
from the sink. Um, she’s drying up at the same time not really paying
attention and it’s all over the floor and splashing everywhere. She’s
not paying attention to anything because the two children there, the,
the boy is climbing on a stool to get to the cookie jar at the high
shelf in a cupboard and he’s about to fall over on the stool, off the
stool, and the girl is laughing at him. He’s reaching a cookie down from
the cookie jar to give her a cookie, but she doesn’t seem to be noticing
that he’s gonna fall over on a three-legged stool. And the woman, the
mother, is also not paying attention to the children; um so she is very
distracted and clearly thinking of other things. She’s standing at the

she’s just basically carrying on with the, the, the, with that. There is
a window which shows a scene which has got a garden and got another
house outside. Then following on round you have; in the other side of
the kitchen you have the girl and the boy. Now the boy is about to
tumble off the stool cos it is slant, it is leaning and doesn’t look
very stable, but he is determined to reach into the, to, to, to, to the,
ha, hoo, cookie jar at the top, and take as many cookies as he can; it
looks like he’s got quite a handful already. And then, going back over
to the other side of the kitchen where the mother is; yes, there are
pots out on the side and, yes, she is ignoring the flow that’s coming
all over the side. Er, but it does look like they look like they’ve got
sort of maybe quite affluent, because of the, sort of the garden
outside, and the house that you can see outside, and the cur, the way
that the cur, the curtains, and it looks like quite a modern kitchen
because it’s all sort of doors, it’s all fitted doors and er; ooh the
cookie jar tells you that it’s cookies on the front, which if you’re
trying to hide them, which I presume you are by putting them on the top
shelf, it’s a bit silly putting them in a jar that says cookie jar. Well
it is isn’t it? And, and, and, and basically, yeah, he’s about to come a
cropper, he might even fall into; oh no, he might even fall into the
mother who’ll then slip in the water and then there’ll only be the girl
who’s left laughing, and she, while, while they’re doing that on the

53,"Pat: There is a woman standing at an overflowing sink and she is
obviously drying up the plates without concentrating on the fact that
the tap is still running. There are two children, a boy and a girl; the
boy is rea, reaching up for a cookie jar on a stool that looks like it’s
going to fall over, and the girl is actually reaching up to him. (1
second) The puddle on the floor (sighs) is showing splashes. There’s a
window with two tied back curtains through which you can see something
of the outside. Er, the lady is wearing what looks like an apron over a

",1
54,"Pat: (1 second) So there is a picture of a, I, I’d argue, perhaps a
family; there’s a mother, two children. There um is a, the mother is
standing by a window, got the window open, she’s washing up a plate; she
could perhaps be, argue, daydreaming or distracted because she’s washing
a plate and as she’s doing it the sink is overflowing. So she may be
distracted when she’s been thinking about turning the tap off, and the
other reason I’d argue that she’s distracted is because she’s also got
the two children, or whoever they are, in the background kinda doing
dangerous things. So one of them is standing on a stool in order to be
able to get to a cupboard which is open and to access a cookie jar,
which is on the top shelf. They’re also trying to um pass it down to a
girl as well, perhaps their sister, and that might be the reason that
they’ve kinda gone off balance as they’re doing it, when they’re taking
the cookies out. Outside the window looks like you’ve got a tree, a
bush, and it’s kinda showing part of the neighbour’s garden as well.
There are a number of different cupboards in the room; some of these are
at lower level, there’s some at high level. On the side of the (1
second) sink there are different um plates, there’s different cups there
as well, and there’s also in the curtain, you can see that one curtain
is tied back, perhaps the other one isn’t, but you can’t tell because
the view’s kind of ex, obscured from where the, the lady’s standing. I
think she perhaps has got an apron on as well while she’s doing the
washing up. (3 seconds) The water, where it’s overflowing, is splashing
off the side as it goes down into forming a pool as well, so perhaps
it’s been on for a while, it’s not just started to overflow. (2 seconds)
On the cookie jar you can see that the lid’s open and that you can see
the cookies in there, as well as it being labelled as a cookie jar. The
child, I think they’ve got one in their hand already and they’re going
for a second one that they’re passing on. The girl has got socks on and
kinda sandal shoes and the boy has perhaps got boots on, it’s hard to
tell what they are. Um (1 second) the mum, or whoever she is, has got
sorta bob hair and the girl’s got perhaps got a bit longer, and I
think she’s got a fringe, as does the mum. Um, the boy who’s climbing up
has kinda got some hair that’s brushed backwards.

whilst the sink is overflowing and the water is falling over the counter

over onto the side but it’s specifically spilling onto the floor; and

Mum’s there drying the pots (laughs) the sink’s full and there’s water pooling on the floor; mum seems oblivious, kids are oblivious. Er, there’s a lot of health and safety issues at stake. There’s some pots there that look as if they’ve been dried. Um, and then looking through the window, there’s a bit of a driveway and a bit of a garden, um there’s sort of like square panelled window, there’s some curtains with tiebacks, there’s about si, eight cupboards; the one that’s, with the cookie jar is a jar. Um (1 second) they seem to be quite happy, the boy and the girl, at the moment, till he breaks his neck. Um (1 second) yeah, there’s lots of er issues going off there. Mum’s making sure that the pots are clean. Interesting to see that it’s a woman who’s drying the pots and doing the pots and looking after the children, rather than a man; um (1 second) I suppose that’s par for the course. Er, I can see some trees in the backgro, ground through the window. I can see what looks like the roof of another house and I can see, it looks like shrubs but it could be people, in the distance. Yes, mum, even though she’s standing in the pool of water is totally oblivious and she looks like she’s come off the old Fairy um washing up liquid advert and she’s sorta posing there. Cookie jar is absolutely enormous but, judging by them, they’re not part of the obesity crisis; the, the two children are quite slim. It looks quite a dated um picture, probably 1950s/1960s um circa. Um, I don’t know whether that water’s hot or cold, but if it’s hot then she could burn herself. I can see some handles on the cupboard doors, um, and (1 second) yeah, she’s got like a sleeveless dress on and a, an old-fashioned like pinny over the top of it and knee-length skirt and sort of little pumps on and she’s got her hair sort of to her ears in a sort of bob, with a fringe.

Er, she’s wiping a plate; she’s probably been doing it for quite a while if she’s got her mind on something else. Out of the window I can see what looks like another house and a path to it, and possibly lawns at the side, or it might be bu (1 second) hedges.
