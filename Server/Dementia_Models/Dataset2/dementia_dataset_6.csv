tilting back on the stool and it looks as if he’s about to fall. The

getting wet, not only because the sink is overflowing but also because
it’s now running across the floor. The cookie jar has its lid off but it
looks as if it’s so full that the lid couldn’t even fit on. Outside the

there’s a garden where you have some kind of trestle and the window
itself is open; you can’t see a great detail in the garden though it
looks as if there may be grass and trees out there; maybe I’m implying

the sink, she’s er wiping a plate with the water splashing onto the
floor, which I’ve already said. There’s two cups and what appears to be
another plate er there already waiting. And the view out of the window
is a garden with a path and what looks like some kinda plant that’s
about two foot high, straggly, and then on the, that’s on the right-hand
side; on the left-hand side there’s like a mound of something that could
be plants, and then something, it looks like it’s another building
through the window, you can see the roof of another building.

family; there’s a mother, two children. There um is a, the mother is
standing by a window, got the window open, she’s washing up a plate; she
could perhaps be, argue, daydreaming or distracted because she’s washing
a plate and as she’s doing it the sink is overflowing. So she may be
distracted when she’s been thinking about turning the tap off, and the
other reason I’d argue that she’s distracted is because she’s also got
the two children, or whoever they are, in the background kinda doing
dangerous things. So one of them is standing on a stool in order to be
able to get to a cupboard which is open and to access a cookie jar,
which is on the top shelf. They’re also trying to um pass it down to a
girl as well, perhaps their sister, and that might be the reason that
they’ve kinda gone off balance as they’re doing it, when they’re taking
the cookies out. Outside the window looks like you’ve got a tree, a
bush, and it’s kinda showing part of the neighbour’s garden as well.

at lower level, there’s some at high level. On the side of the (1

think she perhaps has got an apron on as well while she’s doing the
washing up. (3 seconds) The water, where it’s overflowing, is splashing

it’s been on for a while, it’s not just started to overflow. (2 seconds)

kinda sandal shoes and the boy has perhaps got boots on, it’s hard to

","Pat: Um, scene is in the kitchen. There is a woman who’s drying the
dishes and is probably not concentrating on her job because the sink is
overflowing and the water is falling on the floor as she dries the
plate. She’s looking outside; the window seems to be open and you can
see the garden. Meanwhile the children behind her back are going for the
cookies in the cookie jar on the top shelf in the cupboard and the boy,
seems to be a boy, has stood on the stool, and as he’s handing down the
cookie to the girl who’s putting her finger to the lips and telling him
to be quiet, it looks as though the stool is going to topple over and he
will crash to the ground.

overflowing and forming a puddle under the sink, er which she’s standing

what could be er a front or a back garden, and to the left of her is a
building which could be a garage or a barn or; no, actually it’s part of
the house because you can see curtains hanging in there. Um, she’s
drying or washing a plate and on the counter in front of her are a
couple of cups and another plate. Um, standing behind her are two
children, a boy and a girl; er the girl has got short socks and short,
flat shoes and a, a short skirt. Um, her brother or the male child is
standing on a stool which is toppling over and just on two legs; so I
think it’s all going to end very badly. Um, he’s got his hands in a

chocolate chip cookies or, or chippy cookies. The lid’s off and he’s got
a cookie in his left hand; he looks like he’s trying to take one with
his right for the little girl, er but I suspect in a moment um the
stool’s gonna topple over, he might take the jar with him. I’m really
not sure why the mum’s letting the sink overflow except that I think she
must be very distracted in some way.

There are two children, um a young girl and a boy; the boy is climbing on a chair to get some biscuits out of a cookie jar, um the chair is about to fall over. He’s got some in his hand ready to pass them down to the little girl. Um, the mother is there, she’s er doing the washing up but she’s obviously not paying much attention because the sink is overflowing. She’s drying one dish, um she’s wearing an apron, there’s some er (1 second) plates on the work surface next to her. The window is open, the curtains are drawn back, you can see out into the garden where there’s a path and various plants, you can see another window. Um, the little girl is wearing a skirt and a t-shirt; the little boy’s wearing shorts and t-shirt; the lady is wearing a dress with I think it’s possibly an apron over it. She has short hair, um the little girl has sort of shoulder hair, length hair; the little boy has short hair. He’s passing some cookies down to the little girl; I think I’ve probably already mentioned that. Um, let me see; there are, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven cupboards underneath the work surface, er there are three cupboards on top, one of which has got the cookie jar in it which the boy is taking things out of it. Out in the garden, as I say, you can see some trees, a path, grass, possibly another house in the background as well, I can see some curtains in another window. Um, the lady’s standing in the water and so she’s not paying much attention to what she’s doing; she must be looking at something really interesting er cos she must have very wet feet. The little boy has socks and shoes on, they appear to be, the socks appear to be falling doo, down. The little girl also has socks and shoes on. Um, ch-ch-ch-ch,let me see what else can I see? I think that’s probably about everything.

mum there who is day, daydreaming about her lover will have to take him
to the hospital and get stitches.
